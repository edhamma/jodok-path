Manual for checking your vipassana kamatthana progress
==================================================================

1. N ĀMARUPA PARICCHEDA ÑANA.
In this Ñana or state of wisdom or knowledge, the meditator is able to distinguish NAMA from RUPA For example, he is aware that the rising and falling movements of the abdomen are RUPA and the mind which acknowledges these movements is NAMA. A movement of the foot is RUPA and the consciousness of that movement is NAMA.

The meditator can distinguish between NAMA and RUPA with regard to the five senses as follows :-

        1. When seeing a form, the eyes and the colour are RUPA and the consciousness of the seeing is NAMA.
        2. When hearing a sound, the sound itself and the hearing are RUPA and consciousness of the hearing is NAMA.
        3. When smelling something, the smell itself and the nose are RUPA, and the consciousness of the smell is NAMA.
        4. When tasting something, the taste and the tongue are RUPA, and the consciousness of taste is NAMA.
        5. When touching something, whatever is cold, hot, soft or hard to the touch is RUPA and consciousness of the contact is NAMA.

In conclusion, in this Ñana the meditator realizes that the whole body is RUPA and the mind (or consciousness of the sensations of the body) is NAMA. only NAMA and RUPA exist. There is no being, no individual self, no T, no 'he' or 'she' etc. When sitting, the body and its movement are RUPA and awareness of the sitting is NAMA. The act of standing is RUPA and awareness of the standing is NAMA. The act of walking is RUPA and the awareness of the walking is NAMA.

2. PACCAYA PARIGGAHA NANA 			(Knowledge of
discerning the condition of mentality/
materiality)

In some instances RUPA is the cause and NAMA is the effect, for example when the abdomen rises and consciousness follows. At other times NAMA is the cause and RUPA is the effect, for example the wish to sit is the cause and the sitting is' the effect ; in other words volitional activity precedes physical action.

        h. The meditator conceives that this existance, the next and all existances only derive from the interaction of cause and effect. They consist of NAMA and RUPA only.
i. A single rise of the abdomen has two stages.

3. SAMMASANA ÑANA (Knowledge of comprehending mentality/materiality as unsatisfactory and not-self)

    f. The rising and falling movements are distinct and faint.
    g. There is a feeling of tightness enabling one to see the continuity of the rising and falling. The first state of consciousness ceases and a second begins enabling the meditator to know the ceasing.

    o. Upada, Thiti and Bhanga, that is the coming into being, continuity and passing away stages of both NAMA and RUPA are present but the meditator is not interested, observing only the stage of passing,
    p. The internal objects of meditation, that is the rising falling movements of the abdomen are not clear. External objects, trees etc. seem to shake,
    q. Everything gives the impression of looking at a field of fog, vague and obscure,
    r. If the meditator looks at the sky it seems as it there is vibration in the air.
    s. Rising and falling suddenly ceases and suddenly reappears.

6. BHAYA ÑANA
The sixth state of knowledge is BHAYA ÑANA or 'Knowledge of the appearance as terror'. The following characteristics can be observed :-
    a. At first the meditator acknowledges objects but the acknowledgements vanish together with the consciousness.

    b. The meditator experiences negative, irritable feelings.
    c. NAMA and RUPA can be acknowledged well.
    d. The meditator is aware of nothing but negativity caused but the arising, continuing and passing away of NAMA and RUPA. The meditator becomes aware of Anicca (impermanence) Dukkha (suffering) and Anatta (non-self), which are referred to collectively as the TRILAKSANA.
    e. In contrast to former days, acknowledgement of what is perceived by the eyes, nose, tongue, body and mind cannot be made clearly.

    b. The meditator feels something akin to laziness but the ability to acknowledge objects clearly is still present.
    c. The feeling of joy is absent and the meditator feels bored and sad as though he has been separated from what he loves.
    d. The practitioner may not have experienced boredom before but now he really knows what boredom is.
    e. Although previously the meditator may have thought that only hell was bad, at this stage he feels that only Nibbana, not a heavenly state, is really good. He feels that nothing can compare with Nibbana so he deepens his resolve to search for it.

    g. The meditator may feel that everything is bad in every way and there is nothing that can be enjoyed,
    h. The meditator may not wish to speak to or meet anybody. He may prefer to stay in his room.
    i. The meditator may feel hot and dry as though being scorched by the heat of the sun.
    j. The meditator may feel lonely, sad and apathetic, k. Some lose their attachment to formerly desired fame and fortune. They become bored realizing that all things are subject to decay. All races and beings, even the Devas and Brahmas are likewise subject to decay. They see that where there is birth; old age, sickness and death prevail. So there is no feeling of attachment. Boredom therefore sets in together with a strong inclination to search for Nibbana.

The ninth Ñana to be considered is MUCITUKAMAYATA NANA which can be translated as 'Theknowledge of the desire for deliverance.' This Ñana has the following characteristics :-

    g. It can be said that the characteristics of this ÑANA are ease and satisfaction. The meditator may forget the time which has been spent during practice. The length of time spent sitting might even be as much as one hour instead of the half hour which was originally intended.

12. ANULOMA ÑANA or 'Conformity knowledge :
Adaptation knowledge' follows.
This Ñana can be divided into the following stages :-
    a. Wisdom derived from the preliminary Ñanas starting with the fourth.
    b. Wisdom derived from the higher Ñanas ie. The 37 Bodhipakkiyadharma , qualities contributing to or constituting enlightenment; the 4 Iddhipada or paths of accomplishment; the 4 Sammappadhara, right or perfect efforts; the 4 Satipatthana or foundations of mindfulness; the 5 Indriya or controlling   faculties and the five Bhala or powers etc.
Anuloma Ñana has the characteristics of Anicca, Dukkha and Anatta.
        1. Anicca (impermanance) He who has practised charity and kept the precepts will attain the pa'h by Anicca. The rising and falling of the abdomen will become quick but suddenly cease. The meditator is aware of cessation of movement as the abdomen rises and falls or the cessation of sensation when sitting or touching. Quick breathing is a symptom of Anicca, The knowledge of this ceasing whenever it occurs is called Anuloma Ñana. However this should actually be experienced by the meditator, not just imagined.
        2. Dukkha (suffering) He who has practised Samatha (concentration) will attain the path by way of Dukkha. Thus when he acknowledges the rising and falling of the abdomen or sitting and touching, he feels stifled. When he continues to acknowledge the rising and falling of the abdomen or the sitting and touching, a cessation of sensation will take place. A characteristic of path attainment by way of Dukkha is unbearability. The knowledge of the ceasing of the rising and falling of the abdomen, or the cessation of sensation when sitting or touching is Anuloma  Nana.
        3. Anatta (No-self) He who has practised Vipassana or was interested in Vipassana in former lives will attain the path by Anatta. Thus the rising and falling of the abdomen becomes steady, evenly-spaced and then ceases. The rising and falling movements of the abdomen or the sitting and touching will be seen clearly. Path attainment by Anatta is characterised by a smooth, light movement of the abdomen.
When the movements of the abdomen continue evenly and lightly, that is Anatta. Anatta means 'without substance' 'meaninglessness' and 'uncontrollability'.
The ability to know clearly the cessation of the rising and falling movements of the abdomen, or the cessation of sensation when sitting and touching is called Anuloma Ñana.


The Four Noble Truths
In the Anuloma Ñana, the four noble truths appear clearly and distinctly as follows :-
        1. SAMUDAYA SACCA. This truth is perceived when the abdomen begins to rise or begins to fall, and it occurs at the point that the meditator is about to enter the next Nana, which is called the Gotrabhu Ñana. Samudaya Sacea is also referred to as Rupa Jati and Nama Jati. It is the point of origination of Nama and Rupa. It is the point of origination of both the beginning of the rising and the beginning of the falling movements of the abdomen. Nama Jati is the beginning of Nama and Rupa Jati is the beginning of Rupa. Real perception and experience of these truths is called 'Samudaya Sacca'.

        2. DUKKA SACCA. This truth is perceived when the rising and falling movements of the abdomen can no longer be tolerated because the meditator is aware of their unsatisfactory nature. He perceives that everything must die out and come to an end. In Pali this truth is given the name
CHARĀMARANAM DUKKHA SACCAM. Old age is a deterioration of Nama and Rupa. Death is the extinction, the breaking up, the ending of Nama and Rupa. Death is the extinction, the breaking up, the ending of Nama and Rupa. The perception of the cessation of suffering is called Dukka Sacca.

        3. NIRODHA SACCA. This truth is seen when the rising and falling movements fall away simultaneously. Jati is the limit of knowledge and so the mental acknowledgement of the cessation of the movements of the abdomen also fades away at the same time. This constitutes the state of Nibbana. In Pali this is referred to as 'Ubhinnampi Nissarnam, The state when Dukka (suffering) and the point of origination of Nama Rupa (Samudaya) both cease is called 'Nirodha Sacca'.

        4. MAGGA SACCA. (The Great Truth) In this state of knowledge or wisdom, the meditator is completely aware of the rising and falling of the abdomen. He is aware of the beginning of the rising and falling the middle of the rising and falling and the points when the rising and falling cease. In Pali this state is known, as 'NIROTHAPPACHANANA MAGGA SACCAM. When the ending of suffering and the cessation of the movements of the abdomen are clearly seen this is termed Magga Sacca.

It is necessary for the practitioner to be aware of these four truths simultaneously. It should be like blowing out a candle, ie.
        1. It should be like the point at which the wick of the candle has been used up.
        2. It should be like the point at which the wax of the candle has been used up.
        3. It should be like an overwhelming brilliance which has obliterated the candle light.
        4. It should be like a deep darkness.

The four characteristics of the light given here are likely to appear at the same time and at the same level as the perception of the Four Noble Truths. The state of Nibbana is perceived in Nirodha Sacca, Dukka Sacca Samudaya Sacca and Magga Sacca at the same time.

13. GOTRABHU ÑANA

The next Ñana to be considered is GOTRABHU ÑANA or 'Knowledge at the moment of change of lineage'. Gotrabhu Ñana is the knowledge which entirely separates one from the worldly state. Nama and Rupa, together with Citta (mind) which has become aware of the cessation, both become peaceful and quiet. This means one has become enlightened, having Nibbana as the object. The moment when feeling breaks off, Gotrabhu Ñana is reached.
    1. Uppadam abhibhuyyatiti gotrabhu : Knowledge which covers the arising of Nama and Rupa is called Gotrabhu.
    2. Pavattam abhibhuyyatiti gotrabhu : Knowledge which covers the continuance of Nama and Rupa is called Gotrabhu.
    3. Bahiddhasamkhanranirnittam abhibhuyyatiti gotrabhu: Knowledge which covers the external Nama and Rupa is called Gotrabhu.
    4. Anuppadam Pakkhandatiti gotrabhu : Knowledge which moves towards cessation is called Gotrabhu.
    5. Appavattam nirodham nibbaham pakkhandhatiti gotrabhu : Knowledge which approaches the discontinuance, cessation and Nibbana is called Gotrabhu.
    6. Uppadam abhihuyyatva anuppadam pakkhandatiti gotrabhu : Wisdom which covers the arising and then approaches the non-arising is called Gotrabhu.

To summarize, the moment that feeling breaks off the first time, for about half a minute is called 'Gotrabhu Nana'. The meditator casts off Ñama and Rupa. Awareness grasps Nibbana as its object. This state is between LOKIYA (worldly existance) and LOKUTTARA (supramundane existance). It is not a state of worldly existance or a state of supramundane existance, because it is in between both states. It is like a man who enters a Buddha's hall, one of his feet is outside and the other is inside. You cannot say that he is outside or inside.

14. MAGGA ÑANA
The next Ñana to be considered is MAGGA ÑANA. It can be translated as 'Knowledge of the path'. In this Nana, defilements have been broken off (Samucchedpahara) MAGGA ÑANA has the following characteristics :-
        1. The destruction of some defilements and preparation for the destruction of others. It constitutes a cleansing.
        2. There is clear and complete knowledge of path.
        3. There is a deep knowledge of Dhamma which leads to Nibbana.
        4. Magga Ñana is a deep knowledge of Dhamma which is necessary to reach Nibbana.
        5. It is a deep wisdom which enables the practitioner to eradicate defilements.

Characteristics of Magga Ñana are ;-
    0. After the breaking off of sensation, awareness of the stream of Nibbana lasts for a moment. Some defilements are completely destroyed. Sense of self (ego), sceptical doubt, and a misunderstanding of rules and rituals and diciplines will be cut off during this Ñana. This Ñana has Nibbhana as its object. Nibbana can be reached. There is no doubt about what is right and wrong, about heaven and hell, about the path, the result of the path and Nibbana. There is no doubt concerning life after death. This Ñana is supramundane.
    1. Anuloma Ñana is the last Ñana in which there is happening. After that there is no awareness of anything. Feeling and awareness suddenly cease. It is like a person who is walking along a road and suddenly falls down a hole. The object and the mind which is trying to acknowledge the object both cease to function is the state of Nibbana. This cessation is called Gotrabhu Ñana. This state of wisdom encompasses the cessation of awareness and form.
    2. After Gotrabhu Ñana has lasted a moment this is termed MAGGA ÑANA.

15. PHALA ÑNANA
The fifteenth Nana is called PHALA ÑANA or the 'Knowledge of fruition'. This occurs a moment after Magga ñana. The mind has come to know what happened and has Nibbana as the object. This state lasts for two or three moments. Whenever Magga Ñana happens Phala Ñana follows immediately. There is no interim state. Phala Ñana like Magga Ñana is supramundane. Magga Ñana is the cause and Phala Ñana is the result. The way of entering Gotrabhu Ñana, Magga Ñana and Phala Ñana is as follows :-
    1. The first cessation of sensation is Gotrabhu Ñana and it has Nibbana as its object. It lies between the mundane and the supramundane existances.
    2. The midway cessation of sensation is Magga Ñana and it has Nibbana as its object. It is supramundane. At this point defilements are eradicated.
    3. The final cessation is called Phala Ñana and it has Nibbana as its object. It is also supramundane. The eradication of defilements of Magga Ñana is called 'Samucchedpahara' and means the complete eradication of defilements. In Phala Nana those defilements are prevented from re-occuring This lack of re-occurance is termed 'Patipasamphana Pahara' in Phala Nana. This process may be compared to extinguishing a fire. Imagine a piece of wood which is on fire. If you want to put the fire out you must throw water on the wood so that the flames die down, but the wood will continue smouldering. However if the wood is doused with water again two or three times, the fire will be completely extinguished. This parallels what happens when a meditator eradicates defilements during Magga ñana. The power of defilements still continues so it is necessary to purge it again during Phala Ñana. (Patipasamphana Pahara) is like the second and third applications of water to put out the fires of defilements.

16. PACCAVEKKHANA ÑANA
The sixteenth Ñana is called PACCAVEKKHANA ÑANA or 'Knowledge of Reviewing.' In this Ñana there is a knowledge and contemplation of the path, the fruit, and Nibbana. There is a knowledge of those defilements which have been eradicated and those which still continue.
        1. There is a contemplation of having followed the path.
        2. There is a contemplation of the fact that a result has been obtained.
        3. There is a contemplation of the defilements which have been eradicated.
        4. There is a contemplation of the defilements which remain.
        5. There is a contemplation of the fact that Nibbana which is an exceptional state of awareness has been known and experienced
In addition while the meditator is acknowledging rising and falling, he comes upon the path, the fruit and Nibbana. At the moment he enters the path, the fruit and Nibbana, three conditions occur : Anicca, Dukka and Anatta as previously mentioned. Paccavekkhana Ñana means when the meditator is acknowledging the rising and falling motions of the abdomen he is aware of the total cessation of the rising and falling. After the cessation, when awareness returns, the meditator contemplates what has happened to him. After this he goes on acknowledging the rising and falling movements but they seem much clearer than normal. Considering what has happened is called 'Paccavekkhana Ñana'.
SAMAPATI or Vipassana Trance
There are three kinds of Samapati; Chanasamapati. Phalasamapati and Nirodhasamapati. Here Phalasamapati only will be discussed.

Phalasamapati means seeing the result of the path which you have gained. You can make a wish to enter a Vipassana trance for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 24 hours or longer. The length of time depends on the power of your concentration. If you have good concentration you can stay in the trance state for a long time, but if your concentration is not good you can stay in the trance state for just a short time.

Translator's Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This book is the work of the late Ven. Phra Dhamma Theerarach Mahamuni Mahāthera, the late head of the meditation masters in Thailand, who passed away on the 30th of June 1988.

While he was alive he taught meditation to both Thais and foreigners in Thailand and throughout the world. The Vipassana Centre at Wat Mahadhatu considers that "the Path to Nibbana" is one of the most useful of his books for meditators and those who are interested in meditation. This book covers both theory and practical exercises. So the Vipassana Centre at Section 5, Wat Mahadhatu has decided to reprint this book, to be used as a guide to help those who are interested in Vipassana meditation.

There are three parts to this book. Part 1 is theory. Part 2 is exercises for meditation practice and part 3 is a manual for checking you Vipassana progress.

We hope that this book will prove useful for those who are interested in practising meditation. It can be used as a guide for beginners, but the book alone is not enough, it should be used as additional guidance when practising with a meditation teacher. Those who have extensive experience should consult a meditation master.

We sincerely hope you make progress in your meditation practice.

| May all beings be well and happy.

Foreword to the 3rd Edition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| *Dhammo have rakkhati dhaṃmacāriṃ chattaṃ mahanthaṃ viya vassakāle.*

| The Dhamma shelters the Dhamma-followers like a Great umbrella in the rainy season.

The Principal Teaching of Lord Buddha comprises three categories: The Study of the Scriptures (Pariyatti Dhamma), the Practice of the Dhamma (Patipatti-Dhamma), and Realization (Pativedha-Dhamma). They depend upon each other. Then they can develop Buddhism in the future.

**The Study of the Scriptures** refers to the study of the Tipitaka, the Three Collections of the Buddha's Teaching in which are contained morality (Sila), concentration (Samadhti) and Wisdom (Paññā).

**The Practice of the Dhamma** is directed towards training in and development of ethical conduct, concentration of mind and intuitive wisdom through the system of Budhist Meditation.

**The Stage of Realization being** the result of the practice, brings about Enlightenment and Complete Freedom from all forms of mental defilements. This is termed, "Realization" according to the Buddhist sense and aim of life.

The Study of the Scriptures is like a whole coconut.

The Practice of the Dhamma is like breaking a coconut.

The stage of Realizations is like breaking a coconut and eating all its contents.

All followers should cultivate these three stages so that they will have peace and happiness in present and future lives.

May they all attain the happiness of Nibbana.
